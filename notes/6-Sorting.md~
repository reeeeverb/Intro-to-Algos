## Sorting 

#### HeapSort 
- utilizes a heap 
  - represented as a binary tree with either max or min rules enforced 
  - same mechanism used for priority qs and garbadge collection 

#### Quicksort
- its called binary sort 
- this book is just wrong
- its binary sort 
- istg

#### Counting Sort
- if you know the keys are less than some variable z then you can simply count the number of times each key occurs and then fill in the values to some secondary array Z 
- useful for certain occasions 
- the basis of radix sort

#### Radix Sort
- implements another sorting algo one digit at a time 
  - usually counting sort

#### Bucket Sort
- assumes the input comes from a uniform distribution 
  - results in a faster average running time of O(n)
- seperates the input into buckets and then uses insertion sort on each bucket
  - concats them together
